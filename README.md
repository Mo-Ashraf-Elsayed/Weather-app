    - **Day After Next Day**: Similar to the next day section, displaying the day name,icon expressing the weather conditions, highest and lowest temperatures, and weather condition.
  - **Night Mode**: If the current time is night, a night icon is displayed to indicate itâ€™s nighttime.

- **Location Permission**:
  - On the first load, the app asks for the user's permission to access their location.
  - If the user clicks "Allow," the app displays weather data for the user's current location.
  - If the user clicks "Block," the app will display nothing until the user manually search in input search.

- **Footer**:
  - Contains an email input field and links to social media accounts for contact.

### Contact Page:
